		<h2>Giant ship is blocking the Suez Canal</h2>
		<h3>March 2021</h3>
		<div class="newspaper">
			Some days ago, one of the biggest container ships got stuck in one of the most important water channels of the world. The Ever Given caused a traffic jam in the Red Sea, since more than 230 ships are waiting to enter the Suez Canal, through which all navigation has been suspended. Specialist salvage companies have been brought in to help refloat the ship, and an adviser to Egypt's president has said he hopes the situation will be resolved within two to three days. In the meantime, as butterfly effect, the price of oil increased of 5%, reaching 60 dollars per barrel.

		<h2>EU starts Covid-19 mass vaccination</h2>
		<h3>January 2021</h3>
		<div class="newspaper">
		After EU's medicine regulator approved the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, the vaccination started throughout Europe. “Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year,” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president wrote on Twitter. “The #COVID19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries.”. Older Europeans and healthcare workers are in the priority queue of the campain to inoculate more than 450 million people across the European Union.
		The European Union’s member states made a show of solidarity by waiting for the bloc’s regulatory board to approve the vaccine before beginning coordinated national campaigns. But how those will play out in individual countries is likely to be disparate.

		  <h2>Researchers use ultrasounds to improve diagnosis of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</h2>
		  <h3>January 2021</h3>
			<p style="font-family: PoynterText">A team of researchers at Guizhou Medical University (China) has revealed that ultrasounds can be helpful in the diagnosis of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN). High-resolution ultrasounds are a non invasive tool and shows the characteristics of peripheral nerve morphological changes in patients with DPN. They also investigated the application of shear wave elastography to further improve the efficiency of the diagnosis. Peripheral neuropathy symptoms might include: gradual onset of numbness; sharp, jabbing, or burning pain; extreme sensitivity to touch; lack of coordination; muscle weakness; heat intolerance. 
			There are many cases of DPN misdiagnosed patients for many years. According to Columbia University Medical Center, in more than 50% of cases, the cause can be addressed before the damage is more severe. Therefore, it is extremely important to have efficient and effective diagnosis techniques.
